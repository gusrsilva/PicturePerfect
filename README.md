<h1>PicturePerfect</h1>
An Android application developed at CalHacks 2015 (UC Berkeley's annual 3-day hackathon) in collaboration with Alberto Lozano and Darwin Wu. The application leverages Google's Mobile Vision API, in particular the face tracking functionality in order to track faces, smiles, and open eyes and snap a picture at the perfect moment.
